version 0.005; 2008-04-06

  * bugfix: when UTF8-decoding salt, don't attempt to read freed copy

  * don't rely on typemap handling of AV* arguments, because it's broken
    on perl 5.6

  * add backward-compatibility definition of bytes_from_utf8() function

  * avoid calling XSLoader::load() redundantly, which was causing
    redefinition warnings on older versions of XSLoader

version 0.004; 2008-04-02

  * add backward-compatibility definition of Newx() macro

  * in tests, avoid unreliable "\S" regexp element

version 0.003; 2007-09-26

  * bugfix: in Crypt::Eksblowfish::{Bcrypt,Family}, ensure that the
    Crypt::Eksblowfish that is loaded is recent enough to have the
    UTF8 bugfix

  * bugfix: avoid memory leaks when croaking

  * new class Crypt::Eksblowfish::Subkeyed, with constructors
    "new_from_subkeys" and "new_initial" and subkey access
    methods "p_array" and "s_boxes", which is now a superclass of
    Crypt::Eksblowfish

  * new method "is_weak" (in superclass Crypt::Eksblowfish::Subkeyed)
    to check for weak keys

  * new class Crypt::Eksblowfish::Blowfish, which implements the original
    Blowfish cipher

  * new class Crypt::Eksblowfish::Uklblowfish, which implements Blowfish
    with key length limits removed

  * for efficiency, change objects to point to C key schedule structure
    instead of storing that structure as a Perl string

  * wrap up block argument marshalling code in typemap

  * use "fields" module to structure Crypt::Eksblowfish::Family object

  * in documentation and all source, use precise term "octet" instead of
    "byte"

  * document class methods in a separate section from instance methods

  * tests for key length restrictions

version 0.002; 2007-09-17

  * bugfix: correctly handle UTF8-encoded scalars

  * don't use ppport.h, because it wasn't doing anything for perl v5.6+

  * test POD syntax and coverage

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * rearrange source tree to fit Module::Build convention

  * complete dependency list

  * include signature in distribution

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

version 0.001; 2006-08-12

  * obfuscate Solar Designer's email address, at eir request

version 0.000; 2006-08-06
